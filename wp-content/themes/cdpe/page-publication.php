                Drug checking services (DCS) provide people who use drugs with information on the composition and potency of their street drugs to allow for more educated choices about their drug use and increase their capacity to avoid toxic substances. Preliminary evidence has established that DCS can influence an individual’s overdose-related risk behaviours and enhance their capacity to mitigate these risks. Information revealed through testing can help to protect individuals by motivating them to exercise safer decisions through for example choosing not to consume substances found to contain highly-potent opioids or employing harm reduction strategies (e.g., not using alone, starting with a smaller dose).

          DCS launched by the CDPE will be provided at 3 partnering frontline harm reduction agencies – including Parkdale Queen West Community Health Centre, South Riverdale Community Health Centre, and The Works. Laboratory services to facilitate drug sample analysis will be provided by 3 partnering hospitals – including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, St. Michael’s Hospital, and SickKids. As a component of the Toronto Overdose Action Plan, Toronto Public Health will assist in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the project. Toronto Paramedic Services and the Chief Coroner of Ontario will share data to support the evaluation of DCS. Public Health Ontario, Drug Analysis Services, Street Health, and Toronto Harm Reduction Alliance will play an advisory role in the execution of this pilot study.

          DCS are also being launched in Ottawa and Vancouver under the management of the Sandy Hill Community Health Centre (Ottawa) and the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use respectively. All three sites will maintain ongoing collaborations to maximize the impact of study findings.
